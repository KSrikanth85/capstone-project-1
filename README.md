For more information about the dataset, please refer to the paper Wang, Tong, Cynthia Rudin, Finale Doshi-Velez, Yimin Liu, Erica Klampfl, and Perry MacNeille. A bayesian framework for learning rule sets for interpretable classification. The Journal of Machine Learning Research 18, no. 1 (2017): 2357-2393.



# Conclusion 


Here is the Conlcusion of the "INVECHICLE COUPON Project", After creating the Linear Regression,Decision Tree, Random Forest,Gradient Boosting and SVM models the best fit model is "GRADIENT BOOSTING".
